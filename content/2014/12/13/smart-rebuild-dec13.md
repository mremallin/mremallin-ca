Today's Agenda  
==============    
* Get an engine for spare parts

Thanks to Troy at Troy Wilson Automotive in Williamsburg, I have a spare engine block. It has a head issue and was running on two cylinders, so it should be a good thing to have if I need it.  
Also found out the Corolla doubles as a pickup truck!
