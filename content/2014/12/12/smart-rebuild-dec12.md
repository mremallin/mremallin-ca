Today's Agenda  
==============    
* Remove lower crankcase
* Remove crankshaft
* Remove thrust washers

Had to grind a prybar down to open the crankcase. There are four openings around the block that are about 1-2mm tall which can be used to crack open the seam. Some kind of black RTV. Machine applied most likely.   
Once open, crankshaft is exposed. Main oil seal was still in place, took some force to pull that side up and out. Will have to replace it when putting the engine back together. Probably after the entire block is back together.
Seems like we didn't blow up the main bearings. Top races look fine to my eyes.
