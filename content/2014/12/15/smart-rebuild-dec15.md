Today's Agenda  
==============    
* Start degreasing the timing chain cover.

So, I set up a makeshift degreasing station made of:  
  * Laundry Tub  
  * 1.5" Ball Valve  
  * 5 Gallon Jug  
  * Metal Strainer  
  * Coffee Filters  
  * Degreaser  
  
As I don't have enough to cover the cover, I'll be leaving one side submerged overnight and then switching to the other side in the morning.
