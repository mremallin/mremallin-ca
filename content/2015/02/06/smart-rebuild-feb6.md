Today's Agenda  
==============    
* New tool
* Valves fully out

Took some time today to make a run to princess auto for a valve spring compressor. Ended up getting the biggest one they had, and it was worth every penny. Only downside was that it needed an adapter to reach the valves in the smart car's head. I didn't have the proper one around, so I just used a deep 15mm socket and shook the head a bit to get the retainers out. Worked well enough...
