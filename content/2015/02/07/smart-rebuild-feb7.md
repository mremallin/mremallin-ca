Today's Agenda  
==============    
* Added more to the parts washer

Today, I added some more goodies to the parts washer. Mainly a submersible pump. IT WAS SOOOOO WORTH IT! Parts are really easy to clean with the jet of degreaser and brushes. The coat of oil over all the parts seems to just melt away now.
