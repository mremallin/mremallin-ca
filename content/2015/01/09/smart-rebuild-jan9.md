Today's Agenda  
==============    
* Crack the block open
* Check out internals of old block

Took the day to finally split the block and examine the internals. Some bearings worn in weird ways, but otherwise look good. I may not have needed to split the block. Still an excellent learning experience. Now that everything is in pieces, the fun to put it all back together begins!
