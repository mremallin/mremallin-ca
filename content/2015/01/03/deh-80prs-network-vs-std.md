A while ago I noticed that I didn't have a rear channel in my Corolla's stereo setup. After a lot of digging this evening, the culprit is the STD/NTW swtich on my head unit.  
  
The Difference?  
Standard uses the outputs on the rear as Front, Rear, Subwoofer.  
Network uses them as Front, Bandpass, Subwoofer.  

Now I have a rear again, Yay!
