I’ve started on a project that’s been on my mind for a while. I have an old console stereo that I’d like to modernize (only the electronics; keeping the 50s style).

I’m thinking right now the best way to do this would be Raspbian + MPD. This gives me the flexibility to control it from pretty much anything (toasters too!).
