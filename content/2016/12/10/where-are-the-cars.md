Two questions I've gotten recently are: "What happened to the smart car?" and "What happened to the Jaguar?". The first has been parted out and sold to a smart car enthusiast the second is still sitting at the garage, waiting for a place for Chris and I to work on it. I got overly ambitious with the car plans and it's blown up in my face. I've come to realize now that time for side-projects is starting to drop and I need to prioritize different aspects of my life than I did two years ago.

It's a tough lesson to learn; there's so much that I want to learn about and do in this world and I don't have the {time/space/money} to do it all. I'm hoping that I can get access to a garage or workshop so that I can start to spend some time with the Jaguar.
